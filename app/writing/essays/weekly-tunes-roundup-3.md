This week I started a new stream-of-consciousness writing routine using [Roam's](https://roamresearch.com/) {% raw %}`{{POMO}}`{% endraw %} feature, a 25 minute [Pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) timer built right in. This is the perfect opportunity to make use of my Epic Soundscapes playlist which contains some zen-like ocean, creek, and rain sounds. Perfect for letting your mind wander. Sitting outside helps, too. ðŸ˜‰
