I recently signed up for a bunch of newsletters and I came across this gem from [Jack](https://twitter.com/jackbutcher) Butcher's [Visualize Value](https://visualizevalue.substack.com/):

> We're wired to forage for information in the same way we used to forage for food, but we don't seem nearly as concerned by the possibility of ingesting something poisonous.

This is something worth remembering and telling your friends, spouses, and children about. There are _tons_ of poisonous berries in our feeds. Take a moment right now to toss a few of them into the scrub at the side of the trail.
