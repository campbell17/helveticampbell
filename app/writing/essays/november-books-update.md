About little over six weeks ago I decided to tackle my lack of reading progress [with math]({% post_url 2020-10-06-books-update %}), deducing that if I simply read a certain minimum number of pages per day, I'll finish every book on my list by year's end. Welp...It's working.

Even though I added two books to my original list, I'm still ahead of schedule:

* _The Gift of Failure_ by Jessica Lahey ✅ **DONE**

* _The Coddling of the American Mind_ by Greg Lukianoff & Jonathan Haidt ✅ **DONE**

* _The Right Side of History_ by Ben Shapiro ✅ **DONE**

* _Competing Against Luck_ by Clayton M. Christensen ✅ **DONE**

* _Badass: Make Users Awesome_ by Kathy Sierra ✅ **DONE**

* _Demand Side Sales_ by Bob Moesta ✅ **DONE**

So, what's left?

* _The Innovators Solution_ by Clayton M. Christensen (280 pages)

* _Scale_ by Geoffrey West (Audio, 14hrs 47min remaining)

* _Eloquence_ by Mark Forsyth (Audio, 3hrs 43min remaining)

And just for fun if I have time:

* _The Abide Guide: Living Like Lebowski_ by Oliver Benjamin and Dwayne Eutsey (256 pages)

It's difficult to judge how the audio books will go since I usually consume those at different times that regular readin' books, but the math for the non-audio books works out as follows:

Total pages: 536 (counting The Abide Guide)

Days left: 35

Pages per day needed: 15.31

After a slow first month of not reading at all, I really got into a groove and made huge progress. I have a new morning routine to thank, which I'll most likely be writing about next, so keep your eyes peeled for that.
