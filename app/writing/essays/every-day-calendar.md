I made a frivolous purchase today. When you reach a certain age, you don't really get presents for your birthday any more. I'm not a big shopper and I don't want much, so typically when I want something, I pick it up. However, there are certain things I would love to have that my cheapness will simply not allow. Normally that's that and I leave myself wanting, but with my new goal of writing every day in full swing, I thought I would consummate the journey by buying myself a birthday present.

If you've never heard of [Simone Giertz](https://twitter.com/SimoneGiertz), you're welcome. Now you have. Simone is one of the brightest, most interesting makers in the YouTube space, who originally made her name "making shitty robots". She recently undertook a crowdfunding campaign, the result of which was positively not shitty: a beautiful [every day calendar](https://simonegiertz.myshopify.com/). While it's not cheap, it's also not prohibitively expensive, making it the perfect symbol to represent the small & consistent improvement philosophy that enthralls me so.

Below are some links about the calendar. Being a YouTuber, Simone obviously made videos about its origin as well as the crowdfunding process. I also wanted to include a glowing review by her friend and fellow maker, Adam Savage, which was the reminder that tipped the scales for me actually buying one.
