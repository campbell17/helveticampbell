I suffer from something I bet a lot of people struggle with. I start a lot of books. Sometimes I read the first few chapters right away to try and give myself a fighting chance. Occasionally I even make it halfway through or more before something else draws my attention away. I do finish some, but I get so excited when I come across a new book I want to read, I usually start it before I finish the last one. I even tried to jump start my reading by adding a Basecamp check-in entitled, "How many pages did you read today?". That actually worked for the book I was reading at the time, _Every Tool's a Hammer_ by [Adam Savage](https://www.twitter.com/donttrythis), but I didn't make room in my routine for the next book, and poof: inertia gone. With 4 months left in the year, my goal is to finish every 'started' book. I list them thusly:

<!--more-->

* _The Gift of Failure_ by Jessica Lahey

* _The Innovators Solution_ by Clayton M. Christensen

* _The Coddling of the American Mind_ by Greg Lukianoff & Jonathan Haidt

* _The Right Side of History_ by Ben Shapiro

* _Competing Against Luck_ by Clayton M. Christensen

* _Scale_ by Geoffrey West

* _Eloquence_ by Mark Forsyth

The main challenge for this goal isn't going to be completing these books. It's going to be refraining from starting 10 more while I do. Oh, and lest you think I'm just being a completionist, I've abandoned my fair share of books because they didn't live up to my expectations, bored me to tears, or flat out stunk. I'm enjoying every one of these books so far and there's no earthly reason they aren't already finished.
