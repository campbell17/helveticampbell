When I first read about the [Lizard Brain](https://seths.blog/2010/01/quieting-the-lizard-brain/) by [Seth Godin](https://twitter.com/ThisIsSethsBlog), it put a tangible symbol to the pain of self-sabotages gone by. For some reason, that helped me cope with that part of myself and try harder to keep it at bay. The constant of human contradiction is still bumbling forward as clumsily as ever, but hopefully revisiting Seth's article will revitalize the resistance.
