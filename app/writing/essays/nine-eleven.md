For the past several years I've had a task to complete as the clock approached midnight on September 10th. [TQ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthonyquartararo/), our former CEO, would have me create a one-off homepage for Fulcrum & Spatial Networks to pay homage to the victims of 9/11. He left the imagery completely up to me and though I showed him before we went live, he never once asked for changes. I always appreciated that he trusted me with this simple yet meaningful request, and I feel sad tonight as his recent departure from the company signifies the end of this tradition. However, as a way to keep it going for one more year, I'd like to share some of the images we used in recent years:
