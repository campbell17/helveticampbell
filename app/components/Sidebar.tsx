      <>
        <p className={contentStyles.p}>
          Fourteen years ago, a geospatial technology company named Spatial Networks hired me as their 12th employee and first designer. They needed... everything. My title was UI Designer, but I did it all, online and in print. But we&apos;ll come back to that.
        </p>

        <p className={contentStyles.p}>
          Before that, I founded a design agency called Whiteshark Creations with an engineering colleague. We worked with some great clients in our first year, but I realized agency life wasn&apos;t my calling and I left for other design pursuits.
        </p>

        <p className={contentStyles.p}>
          Prior to going solo, my design career began its infancy, when Macromedia was still a household name and Web 2.0 was hitting it&apos;s bubbly prime. I started as a web designer and this is where I first clapped eyes on naked HTML & CSS - No WYSIWYG editor to hide all the crimes. We had dedicated developers to write all the code, so my exposure and practice only came in fits and starts. I wouldn&apos;t feel the power of `git push origin master` until my first year working at Spatial Networks.
        </p>

        <p className={contentStyles.p}>
          When you&apos;re the only designer for a company with big ambitions, becoming a generalist is a matter of survival. I have sketchbooks with pages chock full of logos, mobile app screens, mobile app icons, and trade show pull-up banners for offshoots of ideas that didn&apos;t (and never would) exist.
        </p>

        <p className={contentStyles.p}>
          I loved it.
        </p>

        <p className={contentStyles.p}>
          But what I loved most was working on the web apps and the marketing websites. Since we were so small, everyone had to be trusted to make what they were doing count without much (or any) oversight. This was the first time I was encouraged to simply address the customer problem and build. There was no time for hand-wringing. 
        </p>

        <p className={contentStyles.p}>
          We took a few cracks at different product ideas. Allinspections, the product I was actually hired to help create, couldn&apos;t find its niche and had to be sunsetted after 18 months. The CEO called me into his office. I was proud of the work we did, but when he told me we had to shut it down, I worried that would be my final meeting at Spatial Networks. Instead, he offered me the opportunity to head up something new: Fulcrum.
        </p>

        <p className={contentStyles.p}>
          Since 2012, this has been the flagship product of Spatial Networks and my number one source of design activity. Unlike prior attempts, Fulcrum struck just the right balance of utility, ease of use, customizability, and extensibility. We were still super lean back then, but now we had people counting on our product. It felt so good to talk to customers about their issues and ideas and be able to mesh them with ours to give their companies leverage just from using our software.
        </p>

        <p className={contentStyles.p}>
          Since then, we grew every month, steady as a rock. We found product market fit. Our founders understood the importance of keeping the team tight. People who didn&apos;t perform didn&apos;t last. I was responsible the strategy and design for the marketing website, the web app, and the mobile app, all while continuing to support the corporate design materials and marketing for our parent company. It&apos;s wild to compare how we operate now with what we achieved back then with so little, but what I learned about the importance of shipping fast to keep the feedback loop tight was invaluable.

          I knew I wanted to be a designer when I realized I wasn&apos;t afraid to get paid.
        </p>

        <p className={contentStyles.p}>
          I&apos;ll explain...
        </p>

        <p className={contentStyles.p}>
          I went to art school where I majored in illustration and photography. Needless to say, after graduation I worked in sporting goods fitting people for running shoes (I was damn good, by the way). I never dug into how to make money with my art because I never felt comfortable with the idea of something so subjective being scrutinized in that way. Like how people who know they&apos;re about to get ripped off scrutinize the gleam in their car salesman&apos;s eye. 
        </p>

        <p className={contentStyles.p}>
          But I was always technically sharp and to me, design was more technical. If someone needed a logo, no problem. Logos cost this much. I fell in love with design because it was the perfect combination of drawing a sublime portrait and troubleshooting my neighbor&apos;s Dell. It always starts with logos, flyers, posters, brochures... so many brochures. In the beginning it was mostly print. When I started, web design was still young. But I kept my eye on it and dabbled where I could and eventually, it&apos;s all I did.
        </p>

        <p className={contentStyles.p}>
          If design called to my logical side, the web called to my preternatural lust for improvement. When I sent that file entitled &quot;business-card-CEO-front_FINAL-FINAL2.pdf&quot; to the printer for that run of 10,000, the mouse-up event on the send button to his hotmail.com business address was what the racing instructors used to call a Pampers™ moment. On the web, however, I could fix a typo faster than that same PDF would load in Adobe Acrobat. I&apos;m not condoning sloppiness, of course. Diapers are expensive.
