Context for this project:

# Portfolio Website Context and Vision

## Overview
This portfolio site should resemble a high-end web application that is both visually appealing and functionally rich. It must feature modern design elements, smooth animations, and dynamic content loading. The site is built with Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS, and the code should follow the guidelines detailed below.

## Site Structure and Navigation
- **Pages:**
  - About
  - Work
  - Writing
- **Content:**
  - Use placeholder content for now; this will be refined later as the project evolves.

## Layout and Structure
- **Navigation & Content Areas:**
  - **Sidebar:** Positioned on the left, this area will contain the logo and navigation links.
  - **Content Area:** Occupies the right side, dynamically hydrating with the appropriate content based on navigation selections.
- **Scrolling Behavior:**
  - Both the sidebar and the main content container should scroll independently while the page background remains static.
- **Margins & Padding:**
  - Ensure generous internal padding in both containers.
  - Apply ample margins from the edges of the browser window, allowing any textured or ambient background to show through the translucent containers.

## Visual Style and Effects
- **Containers:**
  - Utilize abundant internal padding with nicely rounded corners.
  - Implement a translucent "frosted glass" effect on content panels, with a light grey static background. Each container should have soft, high-elevation drop shadows.
- **Typography:**
  - **Display/Headings:** Use *Helvetica* for headings and display text to reflect the "helveticampbell" brand identity.
  - **Body Text:** Choose a modern, highly legible sans-serif font that complements Helvetica; maintain an airy leading to avoid a cramped look.
- **Motion and Interactivity:**
  - Incorporate a parallax effect: as the mouse moves, a subtle shift in the background image should be observed.
  - Use advanced motion and transition effects (via libraries such as three.js, framer motion, or industry standards):
    - Fade in the main layout and content when the site loads.
    - Fade out and in the page's content (copy and images) during navigation transitions while keeping the containers static.


## Component Guidelines
- **Lightbox:**  
  - Enable users to enlarge images via click interaction.
- **Modal Component:**  
  - Should open with clickable triggers and be closable by both an X icon and the Escape key.
- **Popover Component:**  
  - Display rich contextual information on hover. Must allow the specification of both the trigger element and the popover content directly in the code.
- **Drawer Component:**  
  - A sliding panel that emerges from the right side; it should also be closable using an X icon and the Escape key.
- **Consistency Requirement:**
  - All components must adhere to the unified visual style â€” translucent, frosted glass containers with soft shadows and smooth transitions.

## Tailwind CSS and Icon Strategy
- Utilize **Tailwind CSS** for styling, ensuring consistency across all components.
- Default to **Heroicons (outline)** for icons (available at [heroicons.com/outline](https://heroicons.com/outline)).
- For accessible UI components, refer to patterns and components from [headlessui.com](https://headlessui.com/).

## Additional Directives
- Always maintain a consistent visual language across the entire site.
- Any future elements or enhancements must integrate seamlessly with the described aesthetic and functionality.
- Use temporary instructions in Agent chat only for transient needs; this file should capture the core, persistent design and functionality guidelines.

# Next.js Best Practices

1. Always use Next.js native components and capabilities:
   - Use `next/link` instead of `<a>` tags for internal navigation
   - Use `next/image` instead of `<img>` for optimized image loading
   - Use `next/font` for font optimization
   - Use `next/navigation` hooks (useRouter, usePathname, etc.)
   - Use App Router features (loading.tsx, error.tsx, layout.tsx)
   - Use Server Components by default, 'use client' only when needed

2. Data Fetching and Caching:
   - Use Server Components for data fetching when possible
   - Implement proper caching strategies using fetch cache options
   - Use React Suspense boundaries for loading states
   - Utilize generateStaticParams for static page generation
   - Implement revalidation strategies appropriately (ISR)

3. Routing and Navigation:
   - Use dynamic route segments when appropriate
   - Implement proper loading and error states for each route
   - Use parallel routes for complex layouts
   - Implement intercepting routes for modal patterns
   - Use route groups for organizational purposes

4. Performance Optimization:
   - Implement proper metadata for SEO

   - Use Server Components for static content
   - Implement proper form handling with Server Actions
   - Use React Context sparingly and only when needed
   - Consider server-side state management solutions

6. Security:
   - Implement proper CORS policies
   - Use middleware for authentication/authorization
   - Sanitize user inputs
   - Use environment variables for sensitive data
   - Implement proper CSP headers

7. Development Practices:
   - Follow the App Router directory structure conventions

# Semantic HTML Best Practices

## Element Selection Guidelines
1. Navigation
   - Use `<nav>` for primary/secondary navigation menus
   - Avoid nesting `<nav>` elements unless creating distinct navigation sections
   - Don't use `<aside>` for primary navigation

2. Content Sectioning
   - `<main>` for the primary content of the page (only one per page)
   - `<article>` for self-contained content that could be distributed independently
   - `<section>` for thematically grouped content
   - `<aside>` ONLY for content tangentially related to the surrounding content (pull quotes, sidebars with related articles, advertising, etc.)
   - `<header>` and `<footer>` for introductory/concluding content of sections

3. Text Content
   - Use heading elements (`<h1>` through `<h6>`) in a logical hierarchy
   - `<p>` for paragraphs of text
   - `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<dl>` for lists with appropriate semantic meaning

4. Interactive Elements
   - `<button>` for clickable actions that don't change URL
   - `<a>` for navigation between pages/URLs
   - Avoid using divs with click handlers when semantic elements exist

5. Landmarks
   - Each major section should have an ARIA landmark role (either implicit via semantic HTML or explicit via role attribute)
   - Use unique labels for landmarks when there are multiple of the same type

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. Using `<div>` or `<span>` when a semantic element exists
2. Using `<aside>` for primary navigation (use `<nav>` instead)
3. Using multiple `<main>` elements
4. Nesting interactive elements
5. Using heading elements for styling instead of document structure

## Accessibility Requirements
1. All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible
2. Maintain a logical tab order
3. Ensure proper ARIA attributes when needed
4. Provide alternative text for images
5. Maintain proper color contrast
6. Support screen readers with proper element roles and labels

## SEO Considerations
1. Use semantic elements to help search engines understand content hierarchy
2. Implement proper meta tags
3. Use structured data when appropriate
4. Ensure content matches semantic structure

Remember: When in doubt about which element to use, consider:
1. What is the semantic meaning of this content?
2. How would this be announced by a screen reader?
3. Is this content primary, supplementary, or navigational?
4. Could this content stand alone?

# Component Documentation References

## HeadlessUI Reference
Base URL: https://headlessui.com/
Version: v2.1
React Components Documentation: https://headlessui.com/react

When implementing HeadlessUI components:
- ALWAYS check component documentation for built-in props and functionality BEFORE implementing custom solutions
- Never reinvent functionality that exists natively in the component (e.g., use `anchor` prop for positioning instead of custom CSS)
- Always use the latest documented import patterns (e.g., use `MenuButton` instead of `Menu.Button`)
- Always check the component-specific documentation (e.g., https://headlessui.com/react/menu for Menu components)
- Use the official examples as starting points
- Follow the documented patterns for state management
- Utilize built-in attributes (data-* attributes) over custom solutions
- Reference the component API tables for available props and render props
- Use the documented keyboard interaction patterns
- Follow the accessibility patterns provided

## General Documentation Guidelines
1. Always check official documentation first:
   - React/Next.js docs for core functionality
   - HeadlessUI for UI components
   - Tailwind CSS for styling patterns
   - Framer Motion for animations
   
2. Documentation Priorities:
   - Official docs over blog posts or tutorials
   - Latest version documentation over older versions
   - Latest documented patterns over deprecated ones
   - Latest import methods over nested properties
   - Accessibility guidelines from component libraries
   - TypeScript types from official definitions

3. When Implementing Components:
   - Check for built-in state management
   - Use documented data attributes
   - Follow keyboard navigation patterns
   - Implement proper accessibility features
   - Use official examples as reference
   - Never use deprecated patterns even if they still work
   - Always use named imports instead of nested properties when available
   - Check the "Basic example" section first for the canonical way to implement

## Debugging Best Practices
1. When debugging components or functionality:
   - NEVER revert to older/deprecated methods even temporarily
   - Always stick with the latest documented approach
   - If the latest method isn't working, investigate why rather than trying older methods
   - Document any workarounds needed for the latest methods
   - If a latest method truly doesn't work, escalate to library maintainers rather than reverting
   - Keep a consistent approach throughout the debugging process
